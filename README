LDAP Configuration
==================

   This project is currently a work in progress.

   This is an example of how to setup a cluster of directory servers running
   software from the OpenLDAP Foundation.  This cluster will store the
   provisioning information for all of the services provided by ISP In A Can.


About ISP In A Can
==================

   Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where
   we can find information on it.  -Samuel Johnson

   Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice.  -Anton Chekhov

   Sometimes reading the documentation for a project is not enough. Sometimes
   it is easier to learn by examining a working example.  ISP In A Can is
   intended to be an example to those trying to learn how to configure or
   integrate various software packages.  Although not a real world ISP, ISP
   In A Can is a functioning model of an ISP designed to run using only Free
   and Open Source software.
