#         An LDAP Schema for CMU SASL auxiliary properties plugins
#
# [trimmed]
#
# Abstract
#
#    The CMU SASL implementation of the RFC 2222 defines an API for auxiliary
#    properties (auxprop) plugins. Auxprop plugins can store properties.
#    A property can be a user password in cleartext or in a hashed form
#    used by a particular SASL mechanism, or any other information
#    associated with the user. This document describes a schema for the
#    storage of auxprop properties in an LDAP directory server.
#
#
# 1.    Conventions used in this document

#    in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
#    use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].

# 2.    SASL related Attribute Types
#
#
#    This document defines the attribute types cmusaslsecretCRAM-MD5,
#    cmusaslsecretDIGEST-MD5, cmusaslsecretOTP and cmusaslsecretSRP. Their
#    definition is provided below.
#
#
attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.3.8.1.1.1
        NAME 'cmusaslsecretCRAM-MD5'
        DESC 'Prehashed password as described in CRAM-MD5'
        EQUALITY octetStringMatch
        SINGLE-VALUE
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40{32} )
#
#    cmusaslsecretCRAM-MD5 attribute contains the binary representation of
#    the following C structure:
#
#    typedef struct HMAC_MD5_STATE_s {
#        UINT4 ipad_state[4];
#        UINT4 opad_state[4];
#    } HMAC_MD5_STATE;
#
#    i.e. 16 bytes (4 element array of 32bit integers, each element in
#    network byte order) of ipad is followed by 16 bytes (4 element array
#    of 32bit integers, each element in network byte order) of opad. ipad
#    and opad are calculated as defined in [SASL-CRAM].
#
attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.3.8.1.1.2
        NAME 'cmusaslsecretDIGEST-MD5'
        DESC 'Shared secret for DIGEST-MD5'
        EQUALITY octetStringMatch
        SINGLE-VALUE
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40{16} )
#
#    The cmusaslsecretDIGEST-MD5 attribute contains the binary
#    representation of SS (16-octets) as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of
#    [SASL-DIGEST]:
#
#    SS = H( { unq(username-value), ":", unq(realm-value), ":", passwd } )
#
#
attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.3.8.1.1.3
        NAME 'cmusaslsecretOTP'
        DESC 'OTP secret'
        EQUALITY octetStringMatch
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 )
#
#    The cmusaslsecretOTP attribute is a tab separated octet string that
#    contains information relevant for OTP [SASL-OTP] authentication. The
#    syntax of the string is as follows:
#
#      <alg> \t <seq> \t <seed> \t <otp> \t <timeout>
#
#    where \t is the horizontal tab character (%x09),
#
#     <alg> - name of the hashing algorithm as described in [SASL-OTP];
#
#     <otp> - 16 hex digits (in lowercase) of the 8-byte OTP hash;
#
#     <seq> - 4 digit unsigned integer that specifies how many times the user
#             is allowed to log in using the password before it has to change it.
#             This value is decremented each time the user has successfully authenticated;
#
#     <seed> - random string that doesn't contain \t (<<and no NULs?>>)
#
#     <timeout> 20 digit unsigned integer, the time since the Epoch
#             (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970), measured in seconds. It defines
#             the time when the record lock expires. This value is used to lock
#             the record, as OTP doesn't allow for simultaneous authentication
#             by the same user.
#
#    This attribute is multivalued. For example, it may contain multiple
#    OTP hashes for different hashing algorithms.
#
#
attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.3.8.1.1.4
        NAME 'cmusaslsecretSRP'
        DESC 'base64 encoded SRP secret'
        EQUALITY octetStringMatch
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 )
#
#    This is the base64 encoding of the following data described in [SASL-
#    SRP]:
#
#    { utf8(mda) mpi(v) os(salt) }
#
#    where
#
#     mda - message digest algorithm name as defined in [SASL-SRP]
#
#     v - password verifier (<<See: RFC 2945>>)
#
#     salt - a random string, 1 to 255 octets in length
#
#    This attribute is multivalued. For example, it may contain data for
#    multiple message digest algorithms.
#
#
#    <<cmusaslsecretPLAIN is deprecated in favor of userPassword>>
#
#
# 3.    Object Classes
#
#    This document defines the following object class:
#
objectclass ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.3.8.1.2.1
        NAME 'cmuSaslUser'
        SUP top
        AUXILIARY
        MAY ( userPassword $ cmusaslsecretCRAM-MD5 $ cmusaslsecretDIGEST-MD5 $
              cmusaslsecretOTP $ cmusaslsecretSRP) )
#
#    The cmusaslsecretCRAM-MD5, cmusaslsecretDIGEST-MD5, cmusaslsecretOTP
#    and cmusaslsecretSRP attribute types are described in section 2 of
#    this document.  The userPassword attribute type is defined in
#    [RFC2256].
